      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate learner on a journey to become a web developer. Over the past month, I have been working on improving my HTML and CSS skills through FreeCodeCamp and personal projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        My motivation comes from the excitement of building things that can help others, and I look forward to expanding my knowledge with JavaScript and beyond.

      <h2>My Web Development Journey for the past months</h2>
      <p>My web development journey over the past month has been quite eventful. I began learning HTML through FreeCodeCamp, a platform introduced to us by our lecturer as a way to enhance our skills independently. Initially, it was an enjoyable and motivating experience. However, the situation became challenging when our lecturer began emphasizing strict deadlines to complete the tasks. This added pressure made the process overwhelming, especially since we also had other courses to manage.

        Despite this, I understand that our lecturer's intentions are in our best interests, which gives me the determination to keep going for now. That said, I wish there was less pressure, as it has shifted my focus from genuinely improving my web development skills to simply completing assignments quickly. I only hope that, despite the rush, I can retain everything I've learned and apply it effectively in the future.</p>
